## Introduction

In this dataset focusing on Loan Status Prediction, we delve into the information of applicants who have previously sought loans, particularly Property Loans. The pivotal decision of whether to approve or reject a loan application is contingent upon various factors, including Applicant Income, Loan Amount, prior Credit History, Co-applicant Income, and more.

## Project Objective

Our primary objective is to construct a robust Machine Learning Model capable of predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected for a given individual. This prediction relies on an array of factors such as Income, Education, Work Experience, and the individual's history with loans.

## Key Features

1. **Applicant Income:** The financial standing of the applicant.
2. **Loan Amount:** The requested amount for the loan.
3. **Credit History:** Previous credit performance.
4. **Co-applicant Income:** Financial contribution from co-applicants.
5. **Education:** The educational background of the applicant.
6. **Work Experience:** Professional background and experience of the applicant...etc,

## Project Scope

This project involves the classification of individuals based on whether they are eligible to receive a loan. By analyzing key features, we aim to develop a predictive model that aids in the decision-making process of the lending institution.

## Approach

Utilizing Machine Learning techniques, we will train a model to discern patterns within the data and make predictions regarding loan approval. This involves preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, and employing a suitable classification algorithm.

##Data Collection
The dataset is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset
